    <h1 class="section__introtitle">About me</h1>
    <body>A brief overview of how my careers progressed.</body>
    <p class="section__introsubtitle"><strong>Timeline and milestones:</strong></p>
    <body class="body__paragraph">I grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa, the world's largest urban forest! It's where my passion for digital design and graffiti first took root. I started tinkering with MS Paint at the age of 7, and before long, I was creating character designs in Maya, and busting murals all over the city with “The Cosmic Crew”.
      <br><br>
      In 2008/09, I graduated from <a href="https://designcenter.co.za/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> The Greenside Design Centre </a> with a bachelor's degree in Multimedia Design and went on to complete an honors degree in Visual Communications from  <a href="https://www.vegaschool.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Vega</a>.
      <br><br>
      Soon after, I landed my first web design job at a small agency called Creative Solutions, where I built flash and HTML websites for property companies in the city. By the end of 2009, I found myself working for <a href="https://www.clarity.co.za/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Clarity</a>, a digital product, and marketing agency. There I worked on brands such as Virgin Mobile and Vodacom.
      <br><br>
      In 2011, I joined the award-winning team at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gloo-digital-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Gloo Design</a>, where I started to mature my skills as a digital designer, working on blue-chip brands such as BMW, MINI, First National Bank, and South African Tourism.
      <br><br>
      In 2013, I was like, "You know what? I gotta scratch this itch I've got for sports medicine!" And I ended up heading back to university to dive deeper into the field. I continued to freelance as a designer while studying to become a <a href="https://webcms.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/128/Booklets/Bio%20Booklet%202020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Biokineticist </a> at the University of Johannesburg and The University of Cape Town. This was a combined degree that involved an undergraduate in Sports Psychology.
      <br><br>
      From 2013 to 2016, I gained a thorough understanding of research methods, how to work with data, and eventually, strong patient management skills. All of which became extremely useful in my work as a product designer.
      <br><br>
      In 2016, I qualified with a <a href="https://webcms.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/128/Booklets/Bio%20Booklet%202020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BSc (Med)(Hons) Biokinetics</a> and began practicing as a clinician while still taking on freelance jobs as a designer.
      <br><br>
      In 2019, I took a full-time position at a fintech startup with a money management app called <a href="https://www.22seven.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22seven</a>, where I learned a ton about fintech and personal finance, and helped ship loads of cool features accross their iOS, Android and Web apps.
      <br><br>
      In 2020, I was promoted to a lead designer at 22seven and helped lead a team of 2 UX designers and 1 marketing designer.
      <br><br>
    In 2021 I started working at <a href="https://www.metalab.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MetaLab</a> where I have been helping build and accelerate products for early-to-mid-stage startups and enterprise-level organizations within ed-tech, esports, productivity and collaboration, dating, social, fintech, and risk management. 
    <br><br>
    I currently live with my partner in the beautiful city of Cape Town, South Africa.
