  <h2 class="section__subtitle">Project Overview</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">I kicked off 2025 in Boston with a really complexed project called Torc. The goal was to help a newly acquired scale-up called Torc reimagine their digital talent marketplace for tech recruitment. What sets Torc apart is their skill-based matching approach, which avoids the feeding frenzy created by traditional job boards like LinkedIn or Indeed. This creates a more streamlined experience for all marketplace participants. Talent receives opportunities they genuinely care about and have a strong chance of securing, while recruiters gain access to higher-quality candidates who match their specific needs.
    <br><br>As product design lead, my main objective was ensuring the project's overall success while creating a positive experience for both my team and the client. I've been involved in nearly every aspect of the project, with my primary focus on product strategy, UX, and UI design. I've also overseen and art directed the visual design for Torc's new marketing site, collaborating with Cami, a talented visual designer, and Matt, our executive design director.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">What I did</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">Being the product design lead on this one, my main objective is to ensure the overall success of the project and that my team and client have a good time achieving our goal. I've had my hand in just about every part of the project, but mainly focusing on the product strategy, UX and UI. I've also been overseeing and art directing the visual design for Torc's new marketing site alongside Cami, a super talented visual designer and Matt, our exec design director.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">The Challenge</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">Our initial scope for this project was focused around designing a vision for the talent profile that we'd eventually take into development and help Torc build over the next few months. Being a marketplace, one of the big challenges was to think about the talent, community and multiple personas on Torc's side at all levels of the product. 
    <br><br>Bearing in mind that much of what we designed didn't exist, just the data that we could leverage, we also needed to build features and systems that create lasting engagement beyond job hunting, while considering how to build a Torc community, and of course how to really differentiate the platform in a way that Torc could position themselves as serious contenders alongside the big dogs and avoid another clone war.
    <br><br>At the same time, we're also designing Torc's marketing site with a completely new visual direction we've translated to the new product experience. 
    <br><br>Torc was recently acquired by a massive talent company called Randstad, which has also meant that we've had a slightly more nuanced stakeholder dynamic to manage.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">REH and Research</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">After a 31-hour flight and several litres of New England's finest java, we kicked things off in Boston where I got to facilitate a 3-day workshop with the goal of consuming as much knowledge about the product and business as possible, and of course getting to know our awesome client team.
  <br><br>
  We've since run a 2-week research sprint where I worked in tandem with a UX researcher to design and test concepts. This was a true firehose guzzling experience as we looked to learn where and how we could make the most impact for Torc over the coming months. I love this phase of the project as it allows me to really innovate and push things without constraints, as well as formulate an opinion of what this product should be. 
  <br><br>We were really lucky that our client gave us the autonomy and trusted us to make big decisions about the direction they should go.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">Defining the vision</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">Our research centered around two big questions. The first was understanding if our hypothesis of creating a Career Hub that goes beyond job hunting was the right approach. We saw this as a way of building a long-term home base for Talent and setting a new standard in the industry. The other was how we should position the profile considering that we knew we needed to move away from a static resume-type approach to something more dynamic that tells a more vivid story about a candidate.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">Balancing marketplace needs</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">Although we had significant emphasis on the profile from a scope and brief perspective, my responsibility as lead was ensuring profiles functioned effectively within the broader Torc ecosystem. This meant pushing beyond the initial requirements to design a complete user journey with functional prototypes ready for development. A significant portion of our initial work involved asking questions and carefully dissecting the unique workflows across the marketplace.
  <br><br>
  For example, when Matchers ‚Äì one of the many consultants we designed for on the recruiter side ‚Äì access profiles at specific points in their workflow, they've already narrowed down a pool of candidates through the source and match experience (essentially an applicant tracking tool). The features we designed help recruiters maintain context about the job requirements and necessary skills as they evaluate profiles.
  <br><br>
  We also accommodated users who need different levels of information depth. Recruiters typically scan for surface-level skill evidence, while hiring managers need to understand those skills more thoroughly. We addressed this by creating an interactive system that reveals increasingly detailed skill evidence based on how users engage with the profile.

  <br><br>Research showed that recruiters want to see skills as more of a narrative, so we designed a skills timeline that tells more of a story around when and how skills were developed. Instead of a standard list with data, the timeline becomes an interactive utility that's and playful and functional.

  <h2 class="section__subtitle">Creating lasting engagement</h2>
  <body class="body__paragraph">This project was a great example of how we were able to effectively balance vision and immediate feasibility. Despite having to leave quite a few features out of Torc's immediate roadmap, those ideas made a huge impact on their team. The goal from there was to work backwards from the bigger vision to find solutions that would pave the way toward getting there in the future.
  <br><br>
  We pushed boundaries even where we knew the necessary data wasn't immediately available. For example, our focus on growth and community features (neither of which existed yet) helps elevate Torc's value proposition significantly and delivers on our initial promise of creating long-term value for both talent and recruiters.

  <h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Avoiding a clone war</h2>
  <body class="bodyparagraph">Aside the product thinking, one of the big differentiators was the visual direction. Torc is for people who create, innovate, and shape the digital world. So I wanted our visual approach to reflect that spirit, and develop a design language that feels functional, opinionated, and distinctly different from any other talent marketplace. The last thing we wanted to make this product feel like LinkedIn or anything that feels standard, so we had to find ways of making things feel different but usable.
  <br><br>
  The visual language derives inspiration from the Torc logo. We played with the idea of using sharp edges and very dense UI to create something that feels unique, but highly functional to ensure things are scannable as possible.

  <body class="body__paragraph">We're currently in a production phase of the project where myself and Luciano are building out the high-fidelity direction, design system and moving into prototyping. With Torc's new roadmpap set, we'll be working closely with their engineers to start building out the new product.
    <br><br>Overall, this has been one of the most exciting projects and I've learned a ton. Being able to execute on so many different areas of design, while really getting a chance to understand the product and Torc's business is exactly what I'm about and has made a huge difference in producing what we feel is a game changing product for the client.
